### DESCRIPTION
Welcome to the Colorado Public Schools API!

This API contains multiple end points to access data about counties, school districts, and schools in Colorado.

This API follows [RESTful API guidelines.](https://github.com/Microsoft/api-guidelines)

This API is secured with [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/) for user authentication and authorization.

***

### DATA AVAILABLE
The data is split into three tables.
- counties
- districts
- schools

#### Counties Table
First is the counties table that has a one to many relationship with the districts table. The counties table has the following columns:
- id (increments/primary key)
- name (string)
- county_code (string)

##### Table Example

### AUTHENTICATION
In order to use the POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE endpoints, you must provide a JWT to authenticate.  We suggest using best practice and including authentication in the Header but this API can also manage authentication in the body and as a query parameter.

To receive a JWT, please visit our website here: https://sj-da-byob.herokuapp.com/.

#### Example JWT

### API ENDPOINTS
All endpoints can be accessed using the root https://sj-da-byob.herokuapp.com/

- All endpoints will return data as JSON
- GET endpoints do not require authentication
- POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE endpoints require a JWT for authentication in the header (preferred), the body, or as a query parameter

Example schools GET requests with query params: ***'/api/v1/schools?ratioMin=3&ratioMax=6'***
